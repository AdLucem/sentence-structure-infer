NLP Applications course project. Record of the project so far:

## Initial Discussion

## Diff

## Initial Data

## Okay So We Have A Lot Of Diff(erence)

## Observations About Initial Dataset

## Initial Data: Questionable

Major differences observed between the machine-translated data that was provided and the data that was translated by the newly up-and-running Anusaaraka machine translator website. It was concluded that the data provided by Rashid was a melange of several systems, and would not tell us anything about any particular system- thus negating the purpose of working on it.

## Data Collection From Anusaaraka

Manually feeding data to Anusaaraka and taking the translated data.

## Automatic Chunk Alignment

## Going Back To Diff
